The components of ICO_Scrapper compile a complete database of ICO performance
and characteristics data for use in Machine Learning methods.

The run.sh script runs the python scripts in succession:
-scrap_icos_main.py only returns results (full, reduced, reduced w ratings')
for 1 ICO selected by the user
-scrap_icos_main_full.py loops through all coins on coinmarketcap.com and
and returns ICO data
-coindesk_na.py appends the coindesk.com ICO data for the failed (no show
on coinmarketcap) ICOs
-google_news.py finds number of Google news articles for ('[coin]+ICO')
searches. Needs to run several times in the end because Google restricts
number of searches by search bots to 50 per hour per IP.

Sources used for ICO data:
1) coinmarketcap.com (timeseries, token names and symbols)
2) icobench.com
3) icodrops.com
4) tokenmarket.com
5) icorating.com
6) icomarks.com
7) coindesk.com (via the coindesk_data.csv file).

The final output for ML is the "ico_data_full.csv" file and the
"ico_data_full_wr.csv" file. All output is stored in the /outdata
directory within ICO_Scrapper/.

In the ico_data_full.csv file here is the meaning of the columns:

A. FEATURES
-start: ICO start date
-end: ICO end date
-duration: ICO duration in days
-age: ICO age to date (since end of the ICO)
-region: ICO geographical region. Consult the region_category.py file for
details.
-industry: ICO industry category. Consult the industry_category.py file for
details.
-team: team size
-raised: Money raised (in USD)
-hardcap: Fundraising goal (in USD)
-price: ICO token sale price (in USD)
-telegram: Number of followers in ICO telegram channel/chat
-N_google_news: Number of Google News articles
-N_twitter: Number of Twitter followers

B. PERFORMANCE METRICS
-ret_ico_to_day_one: Return of investment at the close of day 1 in the
crypto-exchanges.
-vol_day1: Trading volume at the close of day 1 in the crypto-exchanges
-sharpe_1: Sharpe ratio during 1st month of trading in exchanges
-sharpe_3: Sharpe ration during first 3 months of trading in exchanges
-sharpe_yr: Annualized Sharpe ratio
-sharpe_yr2: Annualized Sharpe ratio adjusted for "risk-free" return based on
performance of top 10 tokens (~80% of total crypto Market Cap)
-beta_btc: Token beta compared to performance of BTC (~33% of total crypto Market Cap)
-beta_top10: Token beta compared to performance of top 10 tokens
-alpha_btc: Token alpha compared to performance of BTC (~33% of total crypto Market Cap)
-alpha_top10: Token alpha compared to performance of BTC (~33% of total crypto Market Cap)

For tokens not listed on coinmarketcap.com the above values were converted to 
(-1.0,0.0,-100.,-100.,-100.,-100,-100.,-100.,-100.,-100.) respectively.

The "ico_data_full_wr.csv" file has the same columns as the "ico_data_full.csv"
file with the exception of two extra columns ("hype" and "risk") based on the
ICO hype and risk scores from icorating.com (max 1.0).

For social media followers the Telegram channel is more important but where it
is lacking the Twitter channel can be used.

The "start" and "end" values need not be features for the ML component. The
"duration" and "age" values on the other hand will suffice.

This leaves the effective total number of features to be 10 and the total number
of performance indicators to be also 10.
